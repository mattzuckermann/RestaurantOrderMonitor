# Eat-Da-Burger_Node-Express-Handlebars



### Purpose of App:
This project is replicating the format of an order monitor like you'd find at many fast food restaurants, used for employees to track orders yet to be made and those that are made and ready to be served.

### GIF Demonstration of App:

### Text Walk Through:

Interacting with the MySQL database "burgers_db," the app uses tracks which burgers shows which burgers have yet to be eaten and which
and selection data of the user, which then matches you with the closest individual score in the friends.js JSON file.

### Data Table Reference:

Burger Name | Burger Devoured?
--- | ---
Cheese | false
Veggie | true
Steak | false

---
